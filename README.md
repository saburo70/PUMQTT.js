a wrapper class for Paho, to ease using MQTT in the browser


Paho is already quite easy to use,  ut I created this wrapper class for myself (cecause I am lazy :) ) to make things a bit more convenient for me.
Feel free to use it and to contribute.

The Eclipse Paho repositoy can be found here : https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript
